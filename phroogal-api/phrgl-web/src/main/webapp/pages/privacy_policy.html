	<b>Use of Cookies</b>
	<p>
		The Phroogal website may use "cookies" to help you personalize
		your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your
		hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs
		or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to
		you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued
		the cookie to you.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a
		convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to
		tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
		example, if you personalize Phroogal pages, or register with Phroogal
		site or services, a cookie helps Phroogal to recall your specific
		information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
		recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,
		shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Phroogal
		website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so
		you can easily use the Phroogal features that you customized.
	</p>
	<p>
		You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web
		browsers automaprivacy_policy_pagetically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your
		browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to
		decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the
		interactive features of the Phroogal services or websites you visit.
	</p>
	<b>Security of your Personal Information</b> Â 
	<p>
		Phroogal secures your personal information from unauthorized
		access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit
		card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through
		the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
		protocol.

		information from children under the age of thirteen. If you are under
