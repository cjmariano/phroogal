        <b class="font_color">Solving The Biggest Financial Problem</b>
        <p>
        	Financial illiteracy is a big issue in America and many programs are aimed to improve the financial wellbeing of millions of Americans. But, why hasn&#8217;t financial education made a bigger impact?
        </p>
        <p>
	  		The problem is that programs and products do not address the way people learn money behaviors - <b>through social interaction and search engines.</b>	
		</p>
		<p>
			After all the classroom training and mobile apps downloaded, people still turn to search to find answers to their money questions. They are then left to sift through countless links, advertisements and search engine optimized information that is often irrelevant and unreliable.

        	Jason Vitug is the founder of Phroogal. He holds an MBA and B.S. in Finance from Norwich University and Rutgers Business School.
        </p>
		<p>                  
			Having worked in the financial services industry for 10 years, Jason championed workplace financial literacy nationwide. In 2012, he left Silicon Valley to travel 
			the world and while sitting on an 8th century temple in Myanmar had an epiphany. He was living a childhood dream and it was then he asked himself, &#8220;How can I help others live their dream lifestyle?&#8221; 
			That question led to Phroogal.  
		</p>
        <p>
        	Originally from New Jersey, Jason grew up in an inner city and learned first-hand how smart money management can help one live richer lives.  He had his fair share of money shortfalls, credit problems and mounting 
        	student loan debt.  It was through education that allowed him to life the Phroogal lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Jason believes people can live richer lives through money-savviness. His personal mission is to increase financial knowledge by enabling social 
        	collaboration online to allow people to live richer lives offline. 
       </p>
       <p>       
       		Jason lives a balanced life enjoying extreme outdoor activities, exploring natural and historical wonders, staring up at the night sky, practices yoga and meditation.
